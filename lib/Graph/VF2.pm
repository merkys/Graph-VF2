=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<matches( $g1, $g2, $options )>

Takes two L<Graph::Undirected> objects, C<$g1> and C<$g2> and returns an array of occurrences of C<$g1> in C<$g2>.
Returned array consists of array references, each array reference describing one occurrence.
In it, encoded as array references, is the list of pairwise vertex correspondences.
First item in a pair is a vertex from C<$g1>, and second item being a vertex in C<$g2>.
No attempt is made to collate isomorphic matches.
Thus a search of N-element cycle graph in itself will produce 2 * N matches due to graph's symmetry.

C<$options> is a hash reference of options with the following keys:

=over

=item C<vertex_correspondence_sub>

A subroutine reference used to evaluate the equality of vertices, called with C<$v1> and C<$v2> from C<$g1> and C<$g2>, accordingly.
Should return Perl true and false equivalents to signify match and non-match, accordingly.
Unless provided, all vertices are treated as equal.

=item C<edge_correspondence_sub>

A subroutine reference used to evaluate the equality of edges, called with C<$v1> and C<$v2> from C<$g1>, and C<$v3> and C<$v4> from C<$g2>, accordingly.
Edges are represented as pairs of vertices and are passed as a flat array.
Should return Perl true and false equivalents to signify match and non-match, accordingly.
Unless provided, all edges are treated as equal.
